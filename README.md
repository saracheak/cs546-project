### introduction
The city isn’t always the most dog friendly place, which we are taking one step towards solving with our website. This app, PupMap, is catered towards dog owners to be able to check the status of nearby dog amenities (specifically parks and canine waste dispensers). Users can log whether the waste bag dispensers are empty or full, cleanliness and busy-ness of the park. 

Users are able to create a “Pupfile” (a Dog Profile), where they can describe their dogs' favourite parks and times. Users can easily interact and see which dogs they may see on their visit to the park and they can easily explore new parks they may want to visit based on specific features like a park with turf or specific hours of operation.
